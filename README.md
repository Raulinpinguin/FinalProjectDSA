# FinalProjectDSA
Final project 

The final code used to create our working executable can be found in the DSA Final Folder, which contains the folders and files from the Visual Studio WinFrames, which was setup on a local device. 

The important code to pay attention to is: MyForm.cpp, MyForm.h, Airport.h, which can be found in the DSA Final/Project1/ path. 
The files in "Work in Progress" Folder are older versions which aided in producing the final product. 

Note: when transferring from collborating in CLion to the development of the GUI, the Airport.cpp and Airport.h files needed to be consolidated into Airport.h of the final folder so that the external WinForms library could function and compile properly.
