# FinalProjectDSA
Final project 

The final code used to create our working executable can be found in the DSA Final Folder, which contains the folders and files from the Visual Studio WinFrames designed which was setup on a local device. 

The important code to pay attention to is MyForm.cpp, MyForm.h, Airport.h, which can be found in the DSA Final
/Project1/ path. 

Note, in transferring from callborating in CLion to development of the GUI, the Airport.cpp and Airport.h files needed to be consolidated into Airport.h of the final folder in order for the external WinForms library to function and compile properly.
